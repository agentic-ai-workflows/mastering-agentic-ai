# 🤖 Mastering Agentic AI  
*Build, Orchestrate, and Empower AI Agents with LangGraph, CrewAI, BeeAI, and AutoGen*

---

## 🌟 Overview  
This repository is my **hands-on journey into Agentic AI** — where Large Language Models evolve from simple chatbots into **autonomous digital collaborators**.  

Here, I explore and implement **core design principles of Agentic AI**:  
- 🧠 **Memory & Iteration** – agents that don’t forget, learn, and improve.  
- 📚 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – smarter responses with context.  
- 🔄 **Reflection & Reflexion** – self-checking, self-correcting intelligence.  
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** – teams of agents collaborating on tasks.  
- 💬 **Conversation-Driven Assistants** – AI that listens, reasons, and acts.  

All projects are inspired by the **IBM Agentic AI Specialization**, but re-written and explained in my own words, ensuring a **copyright-free, educational-first approach**.
